;; NOTE: on revolts this is called when the offical ownership of the settlement has _just_ been changed, 
;; but nothing else has been processed yet, so keep that in mind when doing checks
;; (i.e. you might have a settlement that is the last one of a faction: they would think that they still had
;;  1 settlement remaining, but if you actually check the world they don't have any)
